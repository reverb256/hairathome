Basic event styling for when you need to look nice but don't want to spend a fortune. Simple updos, curls, or smooth styles that work for graduations, parties, or nights out.

**Base Service Includes:**
- Simple updo, curls, or smooth style
- Light setting products
- Basic pins and accessories placement
- One finished look

**Pricing:**
- Simple style (curls, straight, basic updo): $35
- More complex updo: $50

**Add-Ons Available:**
- Trial run: +$25
- Hair extension placement (you provide extensions): +$10
- Travel outside Winnipeg: +$15

**Perfect For:**
- Graduation ceremonies
- Holiday parties
- Date nights
- Family photos
- Work events

**What This Isn't:**
This isn't elaborate bridal styling or red-carpet hair. I do simple, clean styles that photograph well and stay in place. If you need intricate braiding, complex updos, or avant-garde styling, a full-service salon will serve you better.

**What to Bring:**
- Photos of styles you like
- Any accessories (clips, pins, flowers)
- Clean, dry hair (unless adding wash service)

**Booking Tips:**
- Book at least 1 week ahead for weekend dates
- Saturday afternoons fill up fast
- Trial runs recommended for important events
