Straightforward color services for when you need a refresh without the salon markup. I keep it simple - basic colors, root touch-ups, and simple highlights that work for everyday life.

**Base Service Includes:**
- Root touch-ups (single process)
- Basic gray coverage
n- Simple all-over color
- Quick consultation to match your current shade

**Available Add-Ons:**
- Simple highlights (partial): +$15
- Toner/glaze for shine: +$10
- Deep conditioning treatment: +$12

**What I Don't Do:**
- Complex color corrections
- Fashion colors (vivid blues, pinks, etc.)
- Bleach and tone services
- Multi-dimensional balayage

**Why Keep It Simple?**
As a mobile stylist, I carry essential color products that cover the most common needs. For complex color work, I recommend visiting a full-service salon. But for maintaining your current color or covering roots? I've got you covered at a price that makes sense.

**Important Notes:**
- Patch test required 48 hours before service for new clients
- Please arrive with clean, dry hair
- Bring photos if trying to match a specific shade
- Results may vary based on your hair's current condition and previous treatments
