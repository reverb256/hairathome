**How It Works:**
Treatments are designed as add-ons to other services (haircuts, color, blowouts). They process while I work on other parts of your service, so you're not sitting around waiting.

**Not Available Standalone:**
These treatments are only offered as add-ons to haircuts, color, or blowout services. This keeps costs down and makes the most of your appointment time.

**What to Expect:**
- Simple, effective products
- No fancy spa atmosphere - just good hair care
- Applied during your regular service
- You'll feel the difference immediately
