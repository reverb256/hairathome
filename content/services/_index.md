Straightforward hair services at prices that make sense. I keep my base rates low by offering essential services only, with add-ons available if you want extras. No hidden fees, no surprise charges - just honest pricing for reliable hair care.

## How It Works

**Base Services:** Essential haircuts and basic color at budget-friendly prices
**Add-Ons:** Optional extras like treatments, styling, or additional services
**No Packages Required:** Book only what you need, when you need it

## Service Areas

I proudly serve all areas within Winnipeg, including:
- Central Winnipeg (Downtown, Exchange District, Wolseley, Osborne Village)
- South Winnipeg (Fort Garry, St. Vital, St. Boniface, Transcona)
- West Winnipeg (Charleswood, St. James, Fort Richmond, Headingley)
- North Winnipeg (Seven Oaks, River Heights, North Kildonan, St. Johns)

## Booking Information

- **Travel Fee:** Included for all Winnipeg city limits
- **Equipment:** I bring the basics - chair, tools, and essential products
- **Scheduling:** Flexible including evenings and weekends
- **Same-day:** Sometimes available - call to check

## What to Expect

I'm a one-person mobile operation, which means:
- **Simple setup:** I bring what I need, you provide a space
- **Straightforward service:** No spa atmosphere, just good hair care
- **Honest limitations:** I'll tell you if something is beyond my mobile setup
- **Reliable results:** Clean, professional work every time

## Cancellation Policy

I require 24 hours' notice for cancellations. For appointments during peak times (Friday-Sunday), 48 hours' notice is appreciated. Last-minute cancellations may incur a $20 fee.

## Questions?

Not sure if I can handle your specific needs? Just ask! I'm upfront about what I can and can't do with my mobile setup. If I think you'd be better served at a full salon, I'll tell you honestly.
