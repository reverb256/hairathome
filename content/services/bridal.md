No-frills wedding day hair styling for brides who want reliable results without the premium price tag. I come to your location and get you ready for your big day - simple as that.

- Wedding day styling at your location
- One hairstyle of your choice
- Basic pins and setting products
- Simple touch-up instructions

**Pricing:**
- Bride Only: $60 (60-90 minutes)

**What I Need From You:**
- Photos of your desired style
- Any hair accessories you'll be using
- Clean, dry hair on the day
- A space with access to power outlet

**Important Notes:**
- Trial runs are recommended but not required

**What This Isn't:**
This isn't a luxury bridal experience with champagne and a team of stylists. This is reliable, affordable wedding hair from someone who shows up on time and gets the job done. If you're looking for a full bridal suite experience, a traditional salon might be a better fit.

**Why Choose This?**
- Budget-friendly pricing
- Comes to your location
- No salon minimums or package requirements
- Straightforward, no-pressure service
