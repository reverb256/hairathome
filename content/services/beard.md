Straightforward beard trimming when you need to look neat but don't want to pay barbershop prices. Quick, simple, and done at your convenience.

**Base Service Includes:**
- Beard trim and shaping
- Neckline cleanup
- Mustache trim (if needed)
- Light styling with basic product

**Add-Ons Available:**
- Hot towel treatment: +$8
- Beard conditioning oil application: +$5
- Combined with haircut: Save $5

**Pricing:**
- Beard trim only: $15
- Beard trim + haircut: $35 (save $5)

**What to Expect:**
- Quick consultation on length preference
- Clean, even trim
- Sharp lines where you want them
- Natural look - not overly styled

**What This Isn't:**
This isn't a luxury barbershop experience with hot towels, straight razor shaves, or elaborate styling. This is a practical trim that keeps you looking presentable.

**Best For:**
- Regular maintenance between major trims
- Quick tidy-ups before events
- Keeping workplace-appropriate facial hair
- Budget-conscious grooming

**Note:**
I don't offer straight razor shaves or full face shaves. For those services, please visit a traditional barbershop.
