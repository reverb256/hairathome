## Service & Booking

**What areas in Winnipeg do you serve?**
I serve all areas within Winnipeg city limits. I come to your home with my mobile setup:
- Downtown Winnipeg (Exchange District, The Forks, Osborne Village)
- South Winnipeg (St. Boniface, St. Vital, Fort Garry)
- West Winnipeg (Charleswood, St. James, Assiniboine Park)
- North Winnipeg (Seven Oaks, River Heights, St. Johns)
- East Winnipeg (Transcona, Elmwood)

**How long does a mobile hair appointment take?**
Appointment length varies by service:
- Basic haircut: 30-45 minutes
- Haircut with wash: 45-60 minutes
- Basic color (root touch-up): 1-1.5 hours
- Simple event styling: 45-60 minutes

I'll give you a time estimate when you book.

**Do I need to provide anything for the service?**
You need to provide:
- An electrical outlet (standard 120V)
- A sink with running water (for wash services)
- Adequate lighting
- Enough space for my portable chair

I bring all tools, products, and equipment. For color services, you'll need access to warm water for rinsing.

**Is the service sanitary?**
Yes. I follow basic hygiene practices:
- Tools are cleaned between clients
- I use clean capes and towels for each appointment
- I follow Manitoba health guidelines
- Patch tests are done for new color clients

**What if I need to reschedule or cancel my appointment?**
I require 24 hours' notice for cancellations. For weekend appointments, 48 hours is appreciated. Last-minute cancellations (less than 24 hours) may incur a $20 fee. I understand emergencies happen - just contact me as soon as possible.

**Can my pet be around during the appointment?**
For safety reasons, pets should be kept in another room during the service. If that's not possible, let me know when booking and we can discuss options.

## Pricing & Payment

**Are travel fees included?**
Yes, travel is included within Winnipeg city limits. For areas outside the city (Headingley, Birds Hill, etc.), a $15 travel fee applies.

**What payment methods do you accept?**
- Cash
- E-transfer (preferred)
- Credit/debit cards

A 25% deposit may be required for first-time clients or wedding bookings.

**Do you offer discounts?**
Yes:
- **Family discount**: 10% off when booking 3+ haircuts in one visit
- **Combined services**: Save $5 when adding a beard trim to a haircut
- **Referral**: $10 off for you and your referred friend

**Do you accept gift certificates?**
Yes, I offer gift certificates for any amount. They never expire and can be used for any service.

**How do you keep prices affordable?**
- No salon rent or overhead to cover
- I focus on efficient, straightforward services
- I use good quality products without the luxury markup
- One-person operation means no staff costs to pass on

## What I Can (and Can't) Do

**What color services do you offer?**
I keep color simple:
- **Yes**: Root touch-ups, basic all-over color, simple highlights, gray coverage
- **No**: Color corrections, fashion colors (vivid blues/pinks), bleach and tone, balayage, complex multi-dimensional color

As a mobile stylist, I carry essential color products only. For complex color work, I recommend visiting a full-service salon.

**Do you do perms, relaxers, or keratin treatments?**
No. These chemical treatments require specialized equipment and ventilation that I can't provide in a mobile setup. I can refer you to salons that offer these services.

**Can you work with all hair types?**
I have experience with:
- Fine, medium, and coarse hair
- Straight, wavy, and curly hair
- Basic styling for all textures

For intricate braiding, locs, or specialized textured hair services, I may refer you to a stylist who specializes in those techniques.

**What products do you use?**
I use reliable, mid-range professional products that work well without the premium price. All products are standard professional salon brands - nothing fancy, just effective. If you have allergies or sensitivities, let me know and I'll check ingredient lists.

## Before Your Appointment

**How do I prepare?**
- **Haircuts**: Come with clean, dry hair
- **Color**: Don't wash your hair the day of (natural oils help protect scalp)
- **Event styling**: Bring reference photos and any accessories you want to use
- **General**: Wear comfortable clothing that you don't mind getting a bit of hair on

**Do you offer consultations?**
Yes, I do a quick consultation before every service to understand what you want. For color services, I require a patch test 48 hours before if you're a new client or trying a new color.

**What if I'm not happy with the results?**
Let me know right away if something isn't right. I'll do my best to fix it. If I can't meet your expectations, I won't charge you. I want you to be satisfied with the service.

## Safety & Health

**What if I have allergies?**
Tell me about any allergies when booking. For color services, I do a patch test 48 hours before your first appointment to check for reactions.

**Can you work with pregnant clients?**
Most services are safe during pregnancy, but please let me know and I can adjust products if needed. I avoid certain stronger chemicals for pregnant clients.

**What about weather cancellations?**
Winnipeg winters can be rough! If weather makes travel unsafe, I'll contact you to reschedule. I monitor the forecast and won't risk safety for either of us.

**Are you insured?**
Yes, I carry liability insurance for mobile services.
