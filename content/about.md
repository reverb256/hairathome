## Your Neighborhood Mobile Hair Stylist in Winnipeg

I'm Sarah Johnson, and I bring affordable haircuts and basic color services directly to Winnipeg homes. No fancy salon, no premium prices - just reliable hair care that fits real budgets.

## What I Do

I offer straightforward hair services for people who want to look good without spending a lot:
- **Basic haircuts** for the whole family
- **Simple color** - root touch-ups and single-process color only
- **Wash and blow dry** services
- **Beard trims** and basic grooming
- **Simple event styling** for special occasions

## What I Don't Do

I'm honest about my limitations as a mobile stylist:
- **No complex color corrections** - I carry basic colors only
- **No fashion colors** - no vivid blues, pinks, or creative color work
- **No elaborate styling** - simple updos and curls only
- **No chemical treatments** - no perms, relaxers, or keratin treatments

If you need services I don't offer, I'll happily refer you to a full-service salon that can help.

## Meet Your Stylist

Hi, I'm Sarah Johnson. I graduated from Winnipeg Technical College in 2007 and have been cutting hair ever since. I started offering mobile services because I saw how many people - especially seniors, busy parents, and budget-conscious families - needed reliable hair care that didn't require a trip to the salon.

## My Philosophy

**Honest pricing:** Base rates that are actually affordable, with add-ons clearly priced
**Honest service:** I'll tell you if something won't work with your hair type or my mobile setup
**Honest limitations:** I don't pretend to offer salon-level color or styling - I do basic services well

## Why Mobile?

I come to you because it makes sense for a lot of Winnipeg families:
- **Seniors** who have trouble getting to salons
- **Parents** who don't want to drag kids to appointments
- **Busy people** who value their time
- **Anyone** watching their budget

## My Setup

I bring the essentials:
- Portable styling chair
- Quality cutting tools
- Basic color products (single process only)
- Standard styling products
- Clean water supply

I don't bring:
- Shampoo bowls (we use your sink)
- Hair washing stations
- Extensive color libraries
- Fancy spa amenities

## Professional Background

- **Local Certification:** 2007 Graduate, Winnipeg Technical College Hairstyling Program
- **Experience:** 15+ years cutting hair in Winnipeg
- **Mobile Specialist:** 5+ years providing home-based services
- **Community Focus:** Serving families, seniors, and budget-conscious clients

I keep things simple:

3. I show up at your home with my equipment
4. You get a decent haircut at a fair price

No packages to buy, no products to purchase, no upsell pressure. Just reliable hair care that respects your budget.
